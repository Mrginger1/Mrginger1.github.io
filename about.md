I am an Associate Professor at School of Artificial Intelligence, South China Normal University.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree of Computer Science from School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University.
My research topics include first-person videos, image captioning, video question answering, federated learning and time series analysis.

I work in computer vision, machine learning and natural language understanding, where the areas in AI concerned with automatically perceiving the world from human perspectives. More generally, I am interested and actively involved in solving problems by modeling and learning from large amounts of unstructured data such as images and texts, with a large number of agents and distributed devices.
